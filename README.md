# Web-GIS-Area-and-Arc-Calculation
Area and arc calculation on the elipsoid by using Google mapsmashup as my bachelor project.
In this application HTML5, JavaScript and CSS were used. 
This application provides the user with an area and arc calculation on the ellipsoid by using the Google maps mashup. 
3 different Ellipsoid options was added for the user; Hayford, Bessel and GRS80. 
The user can calculate the area and arc either by manually entering the latitude and longitude of two different points as desired or by clicking any two points on the map.
